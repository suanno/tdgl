# H. Tanaka (Periodic spinodal decomposition in binary fluid)

# Abstract
Temperature is oscillated in time as a sine, in a two-component polymer mixture.
Fixing amplitude and period of the oscillation, there is a critical value for the average temperature T*.
Wheter T>T* or T<T*, the system present a pattern that is periodic in time OR a pattern that coarsens (with self-similarity only at large wavvelenghts).


# Experiment

[NOT CLEAR what they are measuring (the surface or an internal section?) and with what apparatus, what are the space scales? And how the contained is made and how it is connected with resevoir]

In this experiment there is a binary mixture of two polymers. In polymer mixture, the phase separation is **isothermal** due to the low diffusion time of the molecules compared with the heat diffusion time.

So the temperature is homogeneous and controlled (without delay) by the resevoirâ€™s temperature.
