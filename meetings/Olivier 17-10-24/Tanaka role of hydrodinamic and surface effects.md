# H. Tanaka (Hydro and surface effects on coarsening)

A solution of a polymer in water is studied in 2 confined situations: 1D capillary tube and two planes very close.

Models for considering both surface and hydrodynamic effects are presented.
Also experiments with temperature quench and different compositions.


- Depending on the lates' distance, you have two different mechanism for bicontinuos phase separation (when the components concentrations are symmetric).

- Introucing mobile solid particles in the mixture, you affect the morphology of the pattern
