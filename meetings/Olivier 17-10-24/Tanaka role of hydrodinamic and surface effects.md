# H. Tanaka (Hydro and surface effects on coarsening)

A solution of a polymer in water is studied in 2 confined situations: 1D capillary tube and two planes very close.

Models for considering both surface and hydrodynamic effects are presented.
Also experiments with temperature quench and different compositions.


- Depending on the lates' distance, you have two different mechanism for bicontinuos phase separation (when the components concentrations are symmetric).

- Introucing mobile solid particles in the mixture, you affect the morphology of the pattern

# Modelling

Firstly, surface effects are neglected and model H is introduced (includes phase sep dymamics and hydrodynamics. Thermal flow effecs are so neglected).

Secondly, surface effects are introduced in the free energy.

# Experiments

Three cases investigated: more wettable component is the majority, or minority enough that there is droplet decomposition and enough symmetric composition to have bicontinuos decomp.

Chap 3: Focus on coarsening

Chap 4: Focus on initial dynamics from initial homogeneous config

Chap 5: Focus on late stage dymamics of domains

Chap 6: Secondary phase sep: if the plates (2D config) are more distant, there is another mechanism for the phase separation in symmetric comp (so bicontinuos phase sep)

Chap 7: Some mobile solid particles are added in the mixture and their effect is studyed with a free energy model and with experiments that show this can be used to control the pattern's morphology.
