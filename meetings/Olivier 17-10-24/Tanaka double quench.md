# H. Tanaka (Double quench)

# Abstract

A **first quench** is made, which produces some domains that coarsen if you wait enough. Once the coarsening is established (the domains are sufficiently big) a **second quench** is made: The **temperature** is **lowered even more**.

## What happens?

The new quench leads to the emergence of **small droplets** **INSIDE** each pre-existant **domain**.

Inside a big domain, only **domains close to the border** feel it and they disappear, this mechanism is known as Lifshitz-Slyozov mechanism. While the domains far from the border **coarsen** due to the Brownian-coagulation mechanism, as the big domains.  **Eventually**, a combination of cohalescence due to the Brownial mechanism and disappearance due to the Lifshitz, makes the small domains to  "evaporate".

## Structure factorâ€™s peaks (To understand)

The structure factor, which is computed as the 2D FFT of a **digital image** (**DIA**) of the sample, shows two peaks related to the first (big) and second (small) order domains.

The absolute peak, is the one related to the first order domains.

It is shown that it decreases before the second quench and after rapidly increases.

This is weird as it is supposed to grow monotonically if temperature is not changed.
