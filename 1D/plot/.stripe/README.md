A 2D stripe has 1D symmetry, so the 1D (logarithmic) coarsening is expected.
Here the 1D TDGL equation is simulated, for two isolated kinks (that resemble the "section" of a 2D stripe).
The lenght of the stripe is monitored and analyzed.

- The lenght it is expected to change VERY SLOWLY when C is constant.
- If C(t) oscillates, this lenght SEEMS oscillates also, but it could be an effect of how you measure this lenght as the kinks width oscillates with C(t) oscillations!!!
