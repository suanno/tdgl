The second analytical approach is the **Multiple scale expansion** that is presented in the Master thesis.
We ran some simulation with oscillatory C(t).
- Then we **measured** the deviation from the kink's shape (both the amplitute of the deviation, as a function of time $\beta(t)$, and its shape as a function of $\chi = \alpha(t)x$).
and calculate the first order correction of the kink's shape.
- Then we **calculated**, using the formulas coming from the analytical approach, $\beta(t)$ and we **solved numerically** (using Mathematica's **NDSolve** function) an ODE to find the shape of the **first order correction** $u_{k_1}(\chi)$.
