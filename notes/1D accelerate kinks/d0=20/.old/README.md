OLD because within the simulations presented in the present folder,
the distance between the kinks was measured by looking at the zeros of the second derivative u_xx(x).

Anyways, as the up down simmetry is preserved by the dynamics, we can extimate the distance between the kinks by simply looking at the zeros of u(x).
We separate the two kinds simulations as, when d is small such that the kinks overlap, the two methods give a different extimate of the distance!
