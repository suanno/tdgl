## What we simulate
The initial state is a state with two kink
$$u(x) = \tanh((x-x_-)\sqrt{\frac12})-\tanh((x-x_+)\sqrt{\frac12})-1$$
where $x_+-x_- \equiv d$ is the distance between the kinks and $L\in[0,L]$ where $L$ is the size of the simulation box.

If $C$ is constant, we expect the distance to decrease logaritmically, with a decay time $\sim e^{-d_0}$.

But in the following simulations, we use
$$C(t)=1+1.5\sin(2\pi t/T);\quad T=35$$
So the average value $\bar{C}>0$, but sometimes $C(t)<0$.
And $T$ is large compared to the intrinsic timescale $\tau \sim \frac{1}{\bar{C}} = 1$.
So we are in the _slow varying limit_.

## How the distance $d(t)$ is measured
An estimate of the distance $d$ is obtained by measuring the distance between the zeros of the function $\partial_{xx}u$, as the interfaces are points where the curvature of the state $u(x)$ changes.

## Simulation with $d_0<<L/2$
In the following **animation**, the measured value of $R(t)$ is represented along with other quantitities.
- **top left**: The state u(x)
- **bottom left**: $\log d(t)$ v.s. $\log (t_c-t)$
- **top right**: Plateau between the kinks $u(L/2)$
- **bottom right**: $C(t)$ 

The value $t_c$ represent the time when the kinks annhilate. It is estimated just by looking at the data of $d(t)$. The estimate of $t_c$ used in the bottom left panel is reported as the title of that panel.
Changing the value of $t_c$ used to calculate $\log(t_c-t)$ influences the plot for values of $t$ close to $t_c$ but not for the values that are very far.

### Amplitude of the plateau's oscillation
The plateau between the kinks ($u(L/2)$) oscillates periodically between about 0 and 1.6, where $1.6\simeq\sqrt{C_{max}}=1.58$ where $C_{max}=2.5$ is the maximum value assumed by $C(t)$.
