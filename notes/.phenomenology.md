# Costant C = 1
Already at $t=1 (= 1/C = \tau)$ you have a smooth profile with visible maximas and minimas.
**Some** _positive_ maximas that you see now at the beginning seem to continue to **grow without moving**; the others disappear. So
    
        The x positions of **surviving** local _positive_ maxima seem to not change in time. And the bigger maxima grow faster than the others. The same for _negative_ minimas.
while other maximas disappear.

The positive maxima seem to have an exponential grow until t=5 7 t=6, **only then** you can see the flattering of peaks. So

    The exponential growth seems to be long as 5/6 times the characteristic time $1/C$. Then you have the flattering due to the non-linear term.

[?][This is strange as the characteristic time for the explosion in $1/C$ and not $5/C$]

# C(t) switching +-1 w/ T=1/2 or T/2=3
It seems that, after a little bit, no more _positive_ maxima are created, just some are destroyed and the surviving ones do not moove.

    After $t=1$, it seems that no more peaks are created, **even when you switch the C value**. The peaks do not moove, even if you switch C.

In both cases the switch is sufficiently frequent that the peaks do not grow as much to see their flattering.
