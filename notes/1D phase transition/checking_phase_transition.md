# Checking if there is a phase transition in 1D
See the [2D case](../2D%20phase%20transition/checking_phase_transition.md) for an introduction.

### Simulations
We can check wheter there is coarsening or the state returns periodically to the same "image" by measuring $\ell = 2\pi/\sqrt{<q^2>}$ as a function of time. If it continues to grow, it means that coarsening is happening, if it stops then it is not.

The lenght-scale seems to continue to grow with time: coarsening.
