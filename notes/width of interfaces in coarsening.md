# Scale invariance problem!!!

We have seen that, in 1D, C(t) controls at least the interface's width.
And keeping C(t) fixed, keeps the width of the interfaces fixed (the just move)

So, if **even in 2D** a fixed value of C fixes the interfaces' widths, then there cannot be scale invariance!
In fact the domains get bigger, while the interfaces do not become thicker.
This means that their time evolution has not the same time dependance!
